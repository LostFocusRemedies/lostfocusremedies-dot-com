Both of which I loved, but doing everything from my laptop, I ended up deciding to stick to UE5, that allows me to preview the animation very well (and in the meantime I got interested in Gamedev, so I\u0026rsquo;m exploring all the aspect of preparing assets for realtime performance aswell.)\nCharacters #\rDesign #\rIt all started with what I\u0026rsquo;m most familiar with, drawing the charcater design. That\u0026rsquo;s fun and quite comfort zone for me, having many years of experience drawing and doing design.\nThe Characters Lineup\rModeling #\rI\u0026rsquo;m working on this project on left over times. So, it\u0026rsquo;s been on-going for a couple years now, and it\u0026rsquo;s fun to see how my skills improved with time!\nPrevious\rNextsads\rRigging #\rI\u0026rsquo;m Rigging in Maya, and putting a lot of emphasys on having a very good topology. This is because it makes the rig a lot lighter, because you need a lot less corrective joints or blendshapes. It takes a little longer at the start, but it pays off very well.\nEnvironments #\rModeling and lookdev #\rAs said earlier, the environments are modeled in Blender, then brought over to UE using USD workflow, that makes it incredibly convenient to jump back and forth.\nAnimation #\rThe animation is done in maya, then brought over to UE5 throug Alembic cache. Nothing remarkably interesting here, at least for me, same same.\nRender \u0026amp; final look #\rIt\u0026rsquo;s all done in UE5, I try to get the viewport image as close as possible to the final look, this totally helps with keeping things speedy.\nBefore using UE5, using traditional offline renderers sucha s cycles, arnold or renderman, I found myself doing a lot of compositing in After Effects, and, while I enjoy it a lot, if also felt like each shot was getting several Gb of data, without necessarily making it a lot better.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s definetely diminishing returns into the full VFX production workflow, especially on a one-man-one-laptop project.\nWoah, you read that far? Cheers, and thanks, I appreciate it.\n","date":"20 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1742460692136-sh-intro-remake/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Silent Hill - Remake","type":"projects"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s lovely to meet you!
